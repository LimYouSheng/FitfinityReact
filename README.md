# Fitfinity

Development entry point for the Fitfinity staff portal. See [AGENTS](AGENTS.md#authority-and-document-ownership) for the document map and engineering instructions.

## Development setup

Use Node 24, Python 3.12, Git and Docker Compose. Install frontend dependencies with `npm ci` from the reviewed lockfile; reuse matching dependencies, prepared images and Playwright caches during routine work. Backend versions and hashes are owned by `backend/pyproject.toml`, its requirements files and `backend/Dockerfile`.

`npm run dev` starts Vite; `npm run build` creates `dist/`; `npm run preview` serves it locally. `npm run build:pages-test` creates the `/FitfinityReact/` demo export. Local ports are not public preview URLs.

## Verification commands

| Command | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run verify:lint` / `verify:health` | Semantic lint and source ownership/health |
| `npm run verify:quality-checker` / `verify:health-checker` | Verifier regressions |
| `npm test -- --reporter=verbose` | Frontend units; append a real test path for focused work |
| `npm run verify:assessments` | Assessment form parity |
| `npm run verify:backend` | Full backend against isolated Docker PostgreSQL, including offline infrastructure checks |
| `npm run verify:infrastructure` | Offline infrastructure checks alone |
| `CI=true npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=list` | Root/Pages/API-fixture builds, PWA and simulator browser suite |
| `npm run test:api-browser` | Real frontend/FastAPI/migrations/PostgreSQL browser suite |

The [full-suite diagram](docs/Architecture/diagram.md#full-verification-suite) explains existing test scopes and planned mutation, performance, security, telemetry and operational verification. Planned suites have no executable command here until implemented.

Required CI and evidence rules belong to [AGENTS](AGENTS.md#verify-and-publish). Test inventories are defined by the verifiers, not historical counts in documentation.

## Configuration

Local prototype development uses `VITE_PORTAL_MODE=demo` and an empty `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. API builds explicitly select API mode and the reviewed API origin. Unsupported API operations do not fall back to demo storage. Public frontend configuration is separate from server secrets; never put credentials in a Vite bundle.

Real-API tests create temporary Docker PostgreSQL databases and synthetic accounts. They require no production database, AWS credentials or Lambda redeployment. The local signed-token provider substitutes Cognito; FastAPI and PostgreSQL are real. The verifier owns isolation checks and cleanup.

Prepared environments may reuse `FITFINITY_BROWSER_BACKEND_IMAGE`, `FITFINITY_BROWSER_RUNNER_IMAGE` and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` with matching source/engine inputs. Keep public CA/proxy settings and TLS verification intact; cloud-specific trust setup stays outside tracked source. If Docker or trust is unavailable, record the blocker rather than substitute SQLite or a simulator.
